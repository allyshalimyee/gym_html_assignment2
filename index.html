<h2 align="center"> <ins>Welcome to IDK Gym</ins> </h2>

<p align="center" float="left"> I Don't Know GYM's mission is to promote sport and fitness for everyone.
There are many individuals who put off going to the gym or exercising because they don't know what to do, 
or how to use the equipment. Well, that is no excuse here! Coming to IDK, you may think "I Don't Know", but after experiencing our classes
 and consulting with our friendly trainers, you won't have this thought again!</p>

we have two indoor swimming pools, a 1500 square feet dance studio and a few  600 square feet dance studios, a pilates studio with specialised pilates equipment and much more!
